# 👋 Hi, I'm Marta

### 🚀 Data & Analytics | AdTech | Programmatic | Growth  

I'm a **data-driven problem solver** with a background in **programmatic advertising and digital marketing**, now transitioning into **data engineering & analytics**. My journey started with optimizing media campaigns, but I soon became fascinated with the **backend of data—how it's collected, structured, and used to drive impact**.  

Today, I'm on a mission to **bridge the gap between marketing and data science**, learning how to build efficient data pipelines, automate workflows, and extract meaningful insights.

## 🌱 Next on my learning roadmap...

I'm aware this is a long journey so I have designed a roadmap for myself to make sure I keep myself accountable and upgrade my skills consistently without burning myself out! 
Right now, I’m focusing on:  

- **Perfecting language skills** SQL, Python
- **Machine Learning Ops (MLOps):** Understanding deployment and model tracking  
- **Frontend & Backend Development** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java
- **Cloud Technologies:** GCP, AWS basics  
- **Building Impactful Dashboards:** Tableau, Looker Studio

## 📂 Portfolio & Projects  

🔗 **[My Portfolio](#)** *(Coming Soon!)* – A collection of projects showcasing my transition from marketing analytics to data science & engineering.
My priority at the moment: grow horizontal, then vertical. My way of learning is to master the language, structure and Machine learning stages first to build a firm foundation from where I can grow. I am focusing on theory and methodology, not building a super complex ML model that I wouldn't completely  understand.  

*(More coming soon!)*
