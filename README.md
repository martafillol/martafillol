## 📂 Portfolio & Projects  

🔗 **[My Portfolio](#)** *(Coming Soon!)* – A collection of projects showcasing my transition from marketing analytics to data science & engineering.

My priority at the moment: grow horizontal, then vertical. My way of learning is to master the language, structure and Machine learning stages first to build a firm foundation from where I can grow. I am focusing on theory and methodology, not building a super complex ML model that I wouldn't completely  understand.

## 🦋 More about me 

🐶 If having a dog is a personality, there it is

🌿 I love plants, although they still die on me sometimes

💎 I'm an obsidian freak (send me your productivity system)

💬 I have a wordpress blog where I expose myself in Catalan > [quanpensomassa.com](https://quanpensomassa.com/)

🚩 Perfectionism might kill me one day. Trying to focus on done > perfect

🚩 Not good at small talk, you  might think I don't like you

🚩 I hate wasting time, I will spend hours trying to auomate something just so I don't have to do a repetitive task that takes 5 min for the next 3 months
